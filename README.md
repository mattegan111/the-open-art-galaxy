# the-open-art-galaxy
A 3D galaxy where contributors determine the functionality of one of many generated planets

## What's the User Experience like?
A 3D rendered environment with lots of 'planets'. You can click on a planet and a 2d world, created by one of many contributors, will be rendered.

## How Do I Contribute as a Developer?
Contributing a planet of your own can take as little as 1 hour, even for a newbie programmer. Read the steps below. 

1. Clone this repo and create your own local branch
2. In the "planets" folder, create a new folder. Name this folder as you please - it will be used to determine the name of your planet when rendered in the Galaxy.  
3. In your new folder, create an HTML, CSS and JS file. This is what users see when they visit your 'planet'.  
  3.0 Optional: To determine what your planet looks like in the 3D galaxy, add a jpg or png image that is named 'planetwrapper' and has 1024x512 dimensions.  
  3.1 At least one html named "index" is required  
  3.2 Link styles and scripts into the html using relative paths. e.g. "./styles.css"  
4. Save, commit, and push your branch to this repo. On Github, select your branch and make a pull request to merge it to main.  
  4.1 If you'd like some (friendly and constructive) feedback on your code, please ask.  
5. Once your contribution is merged and github pages propagates, your planet will be available.

## Feature Release Roadmap
~~1. Ability for contributors to provide a texture for their planet~~  
~~2. Better controls for user navigation of galaxy~~  
3. Animations and scene layout so that planets are organised into orbits.  
4. Animations so the user feels like they're 'entering' the planet  
5. A user 'inventory' to make the experience more like a game, potentially with pre-made functions that contributors can use to read and set user inventory data - perhaps using local storage.  
6. Organise planets in the galaxy in an orbit formation.
